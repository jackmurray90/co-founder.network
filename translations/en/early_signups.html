<h2>Early sign-up incentive</h2>
<p>
  Monetization strategy for this website is to eventually charge $200 a month
  for the ability to create job listings on the site and match them with
  potential candidates. This undercuts AngelList's pricing by 20%%. Obviously,
  the value proposition for potential customers only exists if there are a
  number of existing candidates on the platform.
</p>
<p>
  To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, we are undertaking three measures:
  <ol>
    <li>Onboard high value users early.</li>
    <li>Focus on a restricted market.</li>
    <li>Offer free job listings in the beginning.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  To incentivise early sign-ups of high value users, we are offering 0.05%% of
  annual profits to the first 1000 people who add their CV to the site, paid on
  December 31st each year up to and including December 31 2033. To restrict our
  market, we are making the offer only available to software engineers in San
  Francisco or the Bay Area.
</p>
<p>
  It should be noted that if we can get at least 1000 users on the website it
  is possible that it will be far more successful due to the network effect,
  resulting in more user sign-ups and 1000 or more paying customers. So, there
  is a small chance that adding your CV to the site at this early stage could
  result in $12k or more by 2034. Please take this into consideration.
</p>
<p>
  It is assumed that if you are a software engineer in San Francisco who can
  understand this incentivization scheme, you are already a high-value user.

  To prevent fakes, you must add a link to your CV Network page on your
  LinkedIn profile which will be used for verification. It must be believable
  that you are a real person from your LinkedIn profile. You can remove this
  after you are verified.
</p>
<p>
  Currently %d users have been verified for the promotion.
</p>
<p>
  Payouts will be in Bitcoin or PayPal.
</p>
<p>
  If you can understand our vision and if it is worth it to you, please add
  your CV to our website.
